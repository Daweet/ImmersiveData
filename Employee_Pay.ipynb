    "Using a text editor, write a program that calculates the salary for the week of the employees listed below. If an employee worked more than 40 hours that week, then calculate the remaining hours as time and a half (1.5x the normal rate).The program should print their name and salary earned. Upload your finished script to Github and use its URL for your assignment submission."
